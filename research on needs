Research focused on CSV parsing problems, bank export limitations, and most-wanted features in the personal finance space.

## Research Findings

### 1. Historical Data Access Problem (PDF Bank Statements)

#### Pain Point Discovery
- **Chase Bank:** Only provides 90 days of CSV export; 7 years of history only available as PDF
- **Bank of America & Wells Fargo:** Similar limitations (24 months CSV max, older data PDF-only)
- **User Impact:** Microsoft Excel users cannot import 6+ month old transactions because banks only provide PDF format
- **Current Solutions:** Users pay for third-party PDF converters ($10-30/month) or manually re-enter data

#### Market Size
- Mint shutdown (March 2024) displaced millions of users seeking alternatives
- 67% chose third-party tools; 23% use Monarch Money, 18% YNAB
- All migrating users need historical data to set up new systems

#### Quotes from Research
> "Chase does not offer a direct CSV download option for account activity when querying a specific time range—transactions can only be downloaded in PDF format."
> "Many financial institutions only supply historical transaction data in PDF format, which Excel and other spreadsheet programs do not natively import."

### 2. Split Transaction Support

#### Pain Point Discovery

### 3. Recurring Transaction Detection & Subscription Tracking

#### Pain Point Discovery
